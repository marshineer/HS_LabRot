# Modelling Drosophila Memory in PyTorch

Completed as lab rotation with Henning Sprekeler's group (supervised by Denis Alevi), as part of the Bernstein Computational Center for Neuroscience (BCCN) master program.

## Project Description

This project involves the reproduction of a PyTorch model of the neural mechanisms involved in drosophila (fruit fly) memory. It begins with a reproduction of the model described in [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009205), followed by a simplification of the PyTorch code (without loss of function), and a subsequent extension of the model to add further functionality and to test biological mechanisms such as extinction (i.e. forgetting).

A slide presentation and short report of the project findings are included in the repository.
